Disharmony - A Rollins Archive Podcasting server
================================================

Henry Rollins' Harmony in My Head is one of the best music shows on the radio. RollinsArchive.com do a great job putting each show online but they don't do it in an Podcasting-friendly way.

This little sinatra app scrapes, downloads, tags & posts in an RSS feed each time a new show is put online.

You'll need ID3-Lib installed for this. <http://id3lib-ruby.rubyforge.org/doc/files/INSTALL.html>
