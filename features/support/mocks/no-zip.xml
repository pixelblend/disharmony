			<description><![CDATA[<p>Huge thanks to Tara for helping me get setup  for this year's posts!<br /><br />Thank you all for making 2006 a fun and interesting  year. I've never come across such a great group of people as I have on  this site. It's been a pleasure to do this. I will try to add some new  things in the next few weeks that I hope you will like. I've got a few  ideas, it's just a matter of how to do it. I'm learning all of this as I  go. Check back on Wednesday for the first show of 2007!<br /><br />-Angela</p>
